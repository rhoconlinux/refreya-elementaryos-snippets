Welcome to my repository!

* Repository contains icons replacemnts to popular elementary OS indicators. My goal is to make elementary OS interface consistent in style with third party programs. Some of the icons are taken from another users (look at credits) and some are made by my. Every icon set has it's own installation guide in INSTALLATION.md file. Installation guide contains instructions how to install proper working indicator in ElementaryOS Freya and icon replacement path. Installation guides are made for Numix-Circle icon theme so if you use another theme you have to look for analogy.

* I will appreciate all comments that will help me to improve that repository.

* Feel free to share and modify content!

* If you like what I'm doing, please consider donation. BTC wallet adress is easy to find in installation guides.
